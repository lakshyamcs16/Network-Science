# Network-Science
A short assignment on network science

https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ may Explore libaray(igraphdata) to find different networks in Python to use https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html? format=&task=cla&att=&area=&numAtt=&numIns=&type=&sort=nameUp&view=table (tools to analyse data) https://sourceforge.net/projects/socnetv/

My favorite network repository: http://networkrepository.com/

1. Download a labeled numeric dataset from UCI repository. Compute distances between data points construct a class-wise box plot. Transform the data to graph by using 1st quartile (whole data) of distances as threshold. Find the radius, diameter of the graph. Plot the degree distribution.

2. Download a real network and show that it follows all three properties (small world, clustering coefficient and scale free) or not (minimum 1000 nodes)

3. Compare the effectiveness of Eigen vector centrality on unweighted and weighted networks

4. Compare the communities generated by one hierarchical based, divisive based and modularity based community detection methods using a networks with predefined communities.

A guide on how to install igraph on windows:

1. Install python anaconda 2.7 32 bit only

2. Download wheel: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#python-igraph

> pip install python_igraph-0.7.1.post6-cp27-none-win32.whl

Processing c:\users\username\ContainingFolder\python_igraph-0.7.1.post4-cp34-none-win_amd64.whl
Installing collected packages: python-igraph

Successfully installed python-igraph-0.7.1.post4


3. Follow these steps
